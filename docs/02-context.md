## Context

The Patient Monitoring and Control (PMC) is the interface between doctors and the Patients real time date system, where is stored all the data about the patients. Firstly, it allows doctors to look at their patients lists and get details about them. Secondly, using the bar code scanner, doctors can write adapted drugs prescriptions and the PMC treats the requests and then transmit it, to be write in the database.

The described PMC context is displayed on the following [C4 model](https://c4model.com) [software system](https://c4model.com/#SystemContextDiagram) diagram.
